This is the public repository for my group project for CPSC 481. There were 4 other group members, who worked on this project with me. To run the program you need to cd into the src file
and then you need to run "npm start" if it doesn't work it might be that you don't have all of the packages installed so run "npm install" first and then run "npm start"
